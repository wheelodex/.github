The Wheelodex project is devoted to extracting & analyzing data from wheels,
[Python](https://www.python.org)'s file format for built packages.  The main
attraction is [wheelodex.org](https://www.wheelodex.org), a website exposing
data on wheels from the latest version of each package on [the Python Package
Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org).  Also here are
[wheel-inspect](https://github.com/wheelodex/wheel-inspect), the Python library
at the core of wheel data extraction, along with some helpers libraries made
for it along the way.
